# Statistical Inference on Phylogenetic Trees
This repository contains all the coding implemented for my thesis on statistical inference of phylogenetic trees. The Jupyter notebooks include the code and analysis techniques used to analyse the tree construction and inference, with the help of the Hyperiax library, https://github.com/ComputationalEvolutionaryMorphometry/hyperiax.

## Contents

- **Finite_state_space.ipynb**: Methods for constructing phylogenetic trees from example in https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04155 and the initial analysis.
- **MCMC_Finite_state_space.ipynb**: Detailed MCMC analysis and results obtained from the Finite state space example.
- **Jukes-Cantor.ipynb**: Implementation of the Jukes-Cantor Model for phylogenetic inference.
- **MCMC_Jukes-Cantor.ipynb**: Detailed MCMC analysis and results obtained from the Jukes-Cantor Model.
- **Kimura_2_Model.ipynb**: Implementation of the Kimura Model with 2 parameters for phylogenetic inference.
- **GD_Kimura_2_Model.ipynb**: Incomplete gradient descent analysis obtained from the Kimura Model with 2 parameters.
- **Kimura_3_Model.ipynb**: Implementation of the Kimura Model with 3 parameters for phylogenetic inference.
- **Kimura_4_Model.ipynb**: Implementation of the Kimura Model with 4 parameters for phylogenetic inference.
- **Images Folder**: Graphs and diagrams used in the final thesis paper.
- **More Code Folder**: Additional phyton files with other experiments.
